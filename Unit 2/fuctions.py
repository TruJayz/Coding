# Fuctions - are a set of codes of instructions for the computer to follow
#

# Fuctions come in 2 phases

# phas 1: fuction defintion

def example():

    # phase 2: fuction call/ invocation
    # when we are ready to use a fuction 
    # we write its name to use it.

        # Fuction call.

        # Phase 1: We are decribing the instructions for our custom code.
