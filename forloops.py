# Use a for loop to ask a user to type in 5 words and print each word out in
# the terminal. Once the user has finished typing 5 words, 
# the for loop should end. 

# Clarification: program should ask the user to type in one word. Then the program
# should print it out and ask them to type another word. Your program
# should do this 5 times



# looping through strings
